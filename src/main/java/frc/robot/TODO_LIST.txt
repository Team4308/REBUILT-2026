Swerve Todo list:

Module PIDF should be tuned slightly
switch to pid tolerance?: this is when the pathfinding switches form a path to pure pid, change in constnats
Min aligned time tuning: this is how long the bot waits until ending a pathfinding command once it reaches the target. (constnats). make sure it is as low as possible without having it overshoot and miss
try setAngularVelocityCompensation: search it up, it might be helpful to have? if it works turn it on for auton and teleop both
tune swerve tolerances: how close it is to target befure returning true. as close as possible without it taking a long time to align
tune heading pid, transalation is good

Needs practice field:
Heading and transalation PID still needs to be fine tuned on carpet.
tune PathConstraints
more min aligned tuning?
